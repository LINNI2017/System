- For simple sorting part, I sorted an array with 8 integers.
- For doing experiment part, I sorted three groups of arrays of three kinds,
  includes small, median and large sizes.
	- Specifically, the size of each array is a power of 2, a random integer in a specific range.
	- For the small size array, size is in range [2^1, 2^5].
	- For the median size array, size is in range [2^5, 2^10].
	- For the large size array, size is in range [2^10, 2^15].
- The given pseudo code of sort is a kind of bitonic sort, it does O(N(logN)^2) comparisons.
- The compared bubble sort does O(N^2) comparisons.
- For bubble sort, the best case[lower bound] does O(N) comparisons, the worst case[upper bound] does O(N^2) comparisons.
- For bitonic sort, the best case[lower bound] does O((logN)^2) comparisons, the worst case[upper bound] does O(N(logN)^2) comparisons.
- The hardest part of this assignment is debugging the codes I have written, segment fault kept me debug line by line to find the bug source. Specifically, we are using char* to represent String in C, that's some new syntax I need to get familiar with.
